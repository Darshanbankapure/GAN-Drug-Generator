## Abstract 
Drug design is an important area of study for pharmaceutical businesses.
However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost are
challenges and can create barriers that impact this process. Deep Learning models
are emerging as a promising solution to perform de novo drug design, i.e., to
generate drug-like molecules tailored to specific needs. However, stereochemistry
was not explicitly considered in the generated molecules, which is inevitable in
targeted-oriented molecules. This paper proposes a framework based on Feedback
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that includes optimization strategy by
incorporating Encoder-Decoder, GAN, and Predictor deep models interconnected
with a feedback loop. The Encoder-Decoder converts the string notations of
molecules into latent space vectors, effectively creating a new type of molecular
representation. At the same time, the GAN can learn and replicate the training
data distribution and, therefore, generate new compounds. The feedback loop is
designed to incorporate and evaluate the generated molecules according to the
multiobjective desired property at every epoch of training to ensure a steady shift
of the generated distribution towards the space of the targeted properties.
Moreover, to develop a more precise set of molecules, we also incorporate a
multiobjective optimization selection technique based on a non-dominated sorting
genetic algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can
generate realistic, novel molecules that span the chemical space. The proposed
Encoder-Decoder model correctly reconstructs 99% of the datasets, including
stereochemical information. The modelâ€™s ability to find uncharted regions of the
chemical space was successfully shown by optimizing the unbiased GAN to
generate molecules with a high binding affinity to the Kappa Opioid and
Adenosine A2a receptor. Furthermore, the generated compounds exhibit high
internal and external diversity levels 0.88 and 0.94, respectively, and uniqueness.
